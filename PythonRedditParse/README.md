   Activity 1

1. The gender difference between the number of male and female engineering studens does not come as
   much of a surprise to me, as the gender discrepency in engineering is widely discussed. Notre
   Dame makes a good effort to encourage female students to participate in engineering through
   clubs like SWE and through placing female engineers in the same dorms. What came as a surprise 
   was the difference between the ethnic group representations. In all cases, around 70% of the student
   groups were white. This seems like a shockingly high number relative to the university as a whole.
   Recently, the native american/pacific islander population in computer science is increasing
   along with the african american students. This is a positive trend for the sake of the program's
   diversity.

2. The computer science and engineering department does a good job to provide a welcoming environment
   to its students. I believe that the culture of the field is collaborative, and the program at
   Notre Dame does a good job at reflecting that aspect. Oftemtimes, I find myself meeting new 
   people and working with them in passing, class, or office hours. It's a valuable aspect of the program
   in my opinion, as the students are looking out for one another. The professors look to foster this
   environment through encouraging students to work together on homework and so forth. This is the case
   the majority of the time, but in some circumstances courses can lose focus on the collaborative aspects
   and push students to focus too closely on technical aspects. Though this is important, computer
   science can quickly become frustrating and lonely if the problems are not approached with the 
   correct (growth) mindset. A culture of collaboration is essential when it comes to computer science.

   Activity 2

1. Some advantages of using python are the variety of data structures at your disposal. Rather than
   having simple variables and being limited by those, Python and its flexible typing along with 
   the data structures give the language flexibility. Additionally the Python libraries which you
   can import allow individuals to access more methods for manipulating the data. Python's flexible
   typing also makes it more powerful. You could have written the same program in shell script, but
   it would be more tedious, as these programs rely heavily on the abilities of the dictionaries.
   Using the shell script, it would be more difficult to parse through individual elements in the 
   JSON output. Python and shell scripting are similar in the fact that both are interpreted 
   languages rather than compiled language.

2. Scripting in Python differs from programming in C++, as C++ requires a compiler and Python is an
   interpreted language. Additionally, typing in Python is more flexible than the variable typing in C++.
   In C++, one must declare variables before using them, and it is more difficult to change the types
   of variables. In Python, variables are more fluid. this same program could have been written using
   a C++ map. I believe it would have been more difficult in C++, but still attainable due to the data
   structures at your disposal and the variety of libraries. C++'s nature as a compiled language 
   limits its uses and can cause it to have less flexibility than the shell script or Python.
